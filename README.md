# Testing protractor on angular application

This is just a simple POC to see how to write tests with protractor for angular applications.  
I run these tests against http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/.  
Install protractor first.  
Ensure a Selenium instance is running on its default port.  
Run `protractor test/config/conf.js`.  
There is one test that purposely fails to display an error message.
